  The task is to build an <b><i>approximate K-NN Graph</i></b> for a set of vectors. i.e., for each vector, find its approximate k nearest neighbors in a limited time. For this year's task, k is set to be 100.
</p>
<p>
  A sample dataset will be provided. It contains millions of high-dimensional vectors. We will refer to it as <b>D</b>.
</p>
<p>
  The data in Dataset D is in a binary format that starts with a 4-byte integer, <i>num_vectors(uint32_t)</i>, followed by <i>num_vectors x 100 (num_dimension) x sizeof(float32)</i> bytes of data stored one vector after another.
</p>
<p> We provide both the reading function(ReadBin) to load the dataset and the writing function(SaveKNNG) to generate the output file in the <a href="../baseline/io.h" download><u>io.h</u></a> file.</p>

<p>
  Your goal is to design an efficient algorithm for approximate K-NN Graph construction. For each vector, your output must contain k consecutive ids of the nearest neighbors determined by your algorithm. These neighbor lists are stored one by one and stored in a binary file.
</p>

<p>
  During evaluation, we will replace the sample dataset D with a hidden test dataset. The hidden test dataset is randomly drew from the same dataset where D was sampled from. We will evaluate your algorithms using the hidden test dataset. More details are available in the <a href="task.shtml?content=evaluation">Evaluation</a> section.
</p>



<p>
  More details about the datasets can be found in the dedicated <a href="task.shtml?content=datasets">Datasets</a> section.

<p>
  <b>output.bin format: </b>The evaluation process expects "output.bin" to be a binary file containing  <i>|S| x 100 x id(uint32_t) </i>. <i>|S|</i> is the number of random sample vectors in dataset <i>S</i>, <i>100</i> is the number of nearest neighbors and <i>id</i> is the index of 100-nearest neighbors in the given dataset <i>S</i>.  
</p>
<p>
  Please format "output.bin" accordingly. You can check out our provided <a href="../baseline/baseline.tar" download><u>baseline solution</u></a> on how to produce a valid "output.bin".
