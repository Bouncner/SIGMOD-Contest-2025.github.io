	    The leaderboard ranks the best submission for each team based on the Recall of the given dataset. Only submissions that successfully produce a valid result are considered for the leaderboard.
	    Progress bars indicate how each submission fares in comparison with the other submissions on the leaderboard:
	    the solution with the lowest Recall has an empty progress bar, while the submission with the highest one
	    receives a full bar.
