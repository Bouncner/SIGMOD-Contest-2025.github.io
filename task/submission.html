  <b>Quick start:</b>
</p>
<p>
  Participants are suggested to start with our provided <a href="../baseline/baseline.tar.gz" download><u>baseline solution</u></a>.
</p>
<p>
  <b>Submission:</b>
</p>
<p>
  Each team can make at most <b> 5 submissions</b> each day. The number of remaining submissions will be reset at 11:59:59 PM Eastern Standard Time.
</p>
<p>
  Participants are asked to use <a href="https://www.reprozip.org">ReproZip</a> to pack the solution they want to submit.
</p>
<p>
  ReproZip is a tool for packing input files, libraries and environmental variables in a single bundle (in .rpz format), that can be reproduced on any machine.
</p>
<p>
  A brief guide on how to use ReproZip to package your solution follows.
</p>
<p>
  First of all, you have to install ReproZip on your machine. ReproZip can be installed via pip (<b>pip install reprozip</b>). More details about the installation can be found on the dedicated 
  <a href="https://docs.reprozip.org/en/latest/install.html">Documentation</a> page.
</p>
<p>
  Let's use our baseline solution as one example to show how to use ReproZip. To launch the program, you could run the shell script with the following command: <b>bash ./run.sh</b>.
</p>
<p>
  First of all, ReproZip needs to track the code execution. For this to happen, it will be sufficient to run the following command: <b>reprozip trace bash ./run.sh</b>.
</p>
<p>
  The code will be executed and a hidden folder (called &quot.reprozip-trace&quot) will be created at the end of the process. This folder contains a &quotconfig.yml&quot file, that is a configuration file containing information about input/output files, libraries, environmental variables, etc. traced during the execution of your code. If you want to omit something you think itâ€™s not useful to be packed, you can manually edit this file. Please, be sure not to remove any libraries or files needed to reproduce the code, to avoid the risk of it being not-reproducible.
</p>
<p>
  Finally, to create the bundle, you have to run the following command: <b>reprozip pack submission.rpz</b>.
</p>
<p>
  Please note that, if your code is made up of more than one file, even if they are written in different programming languages, you can trace the execution by using the option &quot--continue&quot. You can find more details in the dedicated <a href="https://docs.reprozip.org/en/latest/packing.html#packing">Documentation</a> page.
</p>
<p>
  At this point, a file called &quotsubmission.rpz&quot will be created and you can submit it using our dashboard.
</p>
<p>
  
  <b>Important Notes:</b>
  <ul> 
   <li>It is important to use the dummy data as the input dataset when packing your submission through ReproZip.</li>
   <li>The name of the submission file should be submission.rpz. </li>
   <li>The size of the submission file can't be larger than 300MB.</li>
  </ul>
